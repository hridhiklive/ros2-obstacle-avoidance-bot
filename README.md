Avoidance Bot (Work in Progress)# ROS2 Obstacle Avoidance Bot
This project simulates a basic mobile robot that avoids obstacles using ROS 2 and Gazebo. It's designed to help me learn ROS2 node architecture, real-time sensor processing, and simulation using RViz and Gazebo.

## Goals
- Implement ROS2 nodes in Python
- Subscribe to LaserScan data for obstacle detection
- Publish velocity commands to `/cmd_vel` for navigation
- Visualize behavior in RViz and Gazebo

## Tools & Tech
- ROS 2 Humble
- Gazebo
- RViz
- Python 3.8
- Linux

## Status
üõ†Ô∏è Work in Progress  
Currently setting up robot URDF model and writing initial Python node.
